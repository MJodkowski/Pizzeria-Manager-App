# Pizzeria-Manager-App

This simple app will allow you to keep track of your pizzerias and the pizzas that they serve. Do note that the app is currently only available in Polish. 

If you would like to run it anyway, you will have to install it as per the instructions below. To run it, however, you will need to apply for a free API key at mapbox (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/) and then enter the command "LEAFLET_MAPS_API_KEY=<your key> ember s" to fire it up.
